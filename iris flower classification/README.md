# Iris flower classification


This is perhaps the best-known example in the field of machine learning.The aim is toclassify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)
from sepals' and petals' length and width measurements.The iris data set contains fifty instances of each of the three species.
This Project is through application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning. Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -

1)Decision tree classifier

2)K nearest classifier

3)SVM

4)Logistic Regression

4)metrics

5)train_test_split 

We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset. This is easy and understable for machine learning staters( Naive ).
